 *  Version: 1.1
 *
 *  Description: This app will periodically (every 5 minutes) check on the status of the camera. If the camera is found to be unreachable 
 *  (404, No Route to host, Connection refused, or Connection timed out), the switch selected will turn off and then back on. This causes the 
 *  camera to reinitialize and should remedy the problem.
